/*
 * File:	awr_delta_views.sql
 * Type:	SQL*Plus script
 * Author:	Austin Hackett
 * Date:	18Apr12
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *	SQL*Plus script containing DDL to create views that automatically
 *	calculate the "delta" or difference between adjacent samples of
 *	data gathered by AWR.
 *
 *	Each of these views is named the same as the corresponding views
 *	in the AWR, except that the prefix of "DBA_HIST" has been replaced
 * 	by a prefix of "DELTA$".
 *
 *	Views are present for the following AWR views:
 *
 *		AWR Name
 *		========
 *		DBA_HIST_IOSTAT_FUNCTION	DELTA$IOSTAT_FUNCTION
 *		DBA_HIST_PERSISTENT_QUEUES	DELTA$PERSISTENT_QUEUES
 *		DBA_HIST_SERVICE_STAT		DELTA$SERVICE_STAT
 *		DBA_HIST_SYSSTAT		DELTA$SYSSTAT
 *		DBA_HIST_SYSTEM_EVENT		DELTA$SYSTEM_EVENT
 *		DBA_HIST_SYS_TIME_MODEL		DELTA$SYS_TIME_MODEL
 *		DBA_HIST_TBSPC_SPACE_USAGE	DELTA$TABLESPACE_USAGE
 *
 *	These views are largely an adaptation of Tim Gorman's sp_delta_views.sql
 *	script found at http://www.evdbt.com/sp_delta_views.sql for the AWR. That
 *      said, not all of Tim's views have their equivalent here, as I'm creating
 *	them as I need them!
 *
 *	Also, see Oracle White Paper "Historical Performance Analysis Using AWR"
 *	by Kurt Engeleiter & Cecilia Gervasio Grant for some of the SQL behind
 *	DELTA$TABLESPACE_USAGE.
 *
 *	Note that TABLESPACE_USEDSIZE in DELTA$TABLESPACE_USAGE includes space
 *	occupied by recyclebin objects. This is a problem/feature of the AWR
 *	DBA_HIST_TBSPC_SPACE_USAGE view. Oracle Support have submitted a bug
 *	request for me.
